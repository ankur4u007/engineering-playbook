### History of Obvious

### Consulting vs Contracting

- Greenfield vs Brownfield
  - Greenfield software is the software that we design and develop from scratch. Brownfield software is one where something already exists and we have to add functionality and/or features to it.
  - Obvious mostly works in greenfield software development but we occasionally work with brownfield stuff too.
