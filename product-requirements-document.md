# Product Requirements Document

A product requirements document \(PRD\) is a document containing all the requirements to a certain product. It is written to allow people to understand **what** a product should do. A PRD should, however, generally **avoid anticipating or defining how** the product will do it in order to later allow interface designers and engineers to use their expertise to provide the optimal solution to the requirements.

Typically, a PRD is created from a user's point-of-view by a user/client. The requirements are then analyzed by a \(potential\) maker/supplier from a more technical point of view, broken down and detailed.
