# Git commands and workflows

* [Rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) - Instead of creating a merge commit to merge a feature from a different branch, we "rebase and merge" the branch to keep a clean commit history. Please read more about how to use it [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase).
* [Cherry pick](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/cherry-pick)
* [`commit --amend`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history): To change the last commit
* `push -f`
