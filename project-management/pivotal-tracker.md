# Pivotal Tracker

## Terms

### **Epic**

Epics capture high-level goals associated with a feature, and usually consist of many stories \(and bugs\). 

It isn't compulsory to have Epics in every project, but they do help in maintaining a sense of "achievement" within the team. Simply completing story after story, fixing bug after bug, can get monotonous... and "completing" an epic marks the end of a consolidated effort by the team.

### **Story**

The smallest part of a feature is called a User Story.  It is a concrete, well-understood, independent unit of work that can be delivered to the user for some demonstrable value \(n.b.: also see Chores\). 

Stories are estimated by using a "points system" before they are started. 

### **Chore**

A purely technical task that does not add _demonstrable_ value to any user of the system. It is important to track such chores because they add value to the overall project. For e.g.: refactoring code, upgrading dependencies, adding automation scripts. 

### **Bug**

A feature in production that does not function as expected. ðŸ’”

### **Blocker**

* A question related to a story that needs to be answered before that story can be worked on.  
* A dependency where another story needs to be completed before a story can be worked on.

### **Release**

A marker in the Backlog that represents a version to be delivered or a milestone to be achieved. All stories "above" a Release marker must be delivered and accepted, before the due date. 

## Lists

### **Current Iteration**

A prioritized list of stories to be worked on during the current iteration. An iteration is usually one \(1\) week long, but this can be configured in Pivotal on a per-project level. 

### **Backlog**

A prioritised list of stories planned to be worked on in the upcoming iterations. 

### **Icebox**

An unprioritsed list of all stories, chores, and bugs. Items from the Icebox are added the Backlog during prioritisation discussions, usually an [Iteration Planning Meeting]().
