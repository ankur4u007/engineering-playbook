# Lessons

This is a knowledge-base of articles, written and maintained by the Obvious engineering team, that attempt to explain various concepts that define our engineering culture.

Some of the articles might be deeply specific to particular tech stacks \(say architecting Android or Web apps\), while others might talk about general programming skills \(say functional programming, or test driven development\).
