# Iteration Planning Meetings

IPMs will be held regularly as part of all projects that we work on. The length of an iteration varies but is usually 1 or 2 weeks. The focus of an IPM is to evaluate what was done \(and not done\) in the previous iteration, and ensure everyone knows what is planned for the upcoming iteration.

From your perspective as a valuable team member, here are the points you should keep in mind:

* Ensure everyone knows what you couldn’t finish in the previous iteration. If you were able to finish everything and did something extra, make sure the team is aware you did something else as well -- this is important for scheduling!
* Understand what is on your plate for the next iteration. If you have thoughts on what you should pick up, feel free to suggest it to the team.
* [INVEST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29) in the stories being discussed is a useful way to ensure they’re ready to be picked up. Talk through the user-facing value for a feature; ensure there is clarity on requirements, assets, flows, etc. 
* An IPM may not enough time for you to be able to judge whether the tasks assigned to you can be done in the duration or not,
